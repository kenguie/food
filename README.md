# Tweat On Food!

## Inspiration

My friend is in the process of losing her restaurant because she in part, did not know what to do in order to properly run a restaurant. 
I, believing that helpful people abound in the world, and that with more information, she could have succeeded, she may not have had to fold so soon.

## How it works

It's a social site that allows restauranteurs from all over the world to connect and interact and advise each other.
It has ways of signifying an "Expert in the field" and ways to find their restaurant on Google maps and find out more information about them.

## What's next for TweatOnFood!

I want to create a Bio page for each restaurant owner or restaurant worker in order to give more advice / directly communicate / or even share recipes should they desire.
